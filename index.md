<p> 
Download Git and open a terminal using "Ctrl" + "`" (for Windows), type your account (for me, it is $ ssh cs15lwi23amf@ieng6.ucsd.edu). When you enter your account for the first time, it will ask if you want to continue. Type yes and enter your password (for security purpose, the password will not appear when you type.)

<p> This is the output you will get when finishing the process above. The terminal is now connected to UCSD CSE basement. </p>

<p> I tried all the useful commands and tried to access other group member's directory. However, I was not able to do so because the permission was denied. </p>
